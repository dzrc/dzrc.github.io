### Institutional Lending Breakthrough with XRP

Ault Capital Group (ACG), a subsidiary of Hyperscale Data Inc., is pioneering institutional XRP lending through an enterprise platform launching in Q3 2025. This platform enables public companies listed on NYSE, NYSE American, and Nasdaq to access asset-backed crypto loans using XRP.

**Platform Highlights:**
- Initial XRP acquisition: $10 million
- Loan structure: On-chain agreements via XRP Ledger
- Risk mitigation: CME XRP futures hedging
- Expansion roadmap: Real-world asset tokenization

"The XRP Ledger's enterprise-grade features provide unparalleled efficiency for institutional lending," explained Milton "Todd" Ault III, Hyperscale Data's Executive Chairman. Loan agreements will be recorded on-chain, leveraging the XRP Ledger's renowned speed and scalability.

### Market Analysis: XRP Price Dynamics

As of June 1, XRP trades at $2.15 after correcting from a $2.60 monthly high. Technical indicators suggest potential for renewed bullish momentum:

| Indicator        | Current Status    | Implication         |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Fibonacci Level  | 0.382 Support     | Strong demand zone  |
| MACD             | Green crossover   | Bullish reversal    |
| RSI              | 55                | Neutral to bullish  |

**Key Resistance Levels:**

Failure to maintain $2.10 support could trigger a return to $2.00, but the 200 EMA provides strong technical support at this level.
