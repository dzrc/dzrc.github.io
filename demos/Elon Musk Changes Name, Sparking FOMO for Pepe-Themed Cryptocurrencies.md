# Elon Musk Changes Name, Sparking FOMO for Pepe-Themed Cryptocurrencies

## The Rise of Pepe-Themed Cryptocurrencies  

### Elon Musk‚Äôs Kekius Maximus Move  
Elon Musk‚Äôs December 2024 retweets of Kek-themed content marked the beginning of a new meme coin frenzy. His endorsement of two projects‚Äî**Kekius Maximus ($KM)** on Solana and **Kekius ($KEKIUS)** on Ethereum‚Äîsparked a surge in investor interest. The latter token, $KEKIUS, experienced a staggering **1,000% price surge** within 24 hours of Musk‚Äôs engagement.  

Musk‚Äôs affinity for internet culture and meme coins is well-documented. His previous endorsements of **Dogecoin ($DOGE)** and **FLOKI** have historically driven market volatility, and this latest move aligns with his pattern of leveraging social media to influence crypto trends.  

### Wall Street Pepe: A Community-Driven Powerhouse  
Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has emerged as a standout player in the meme coin ecosystem. Valued at **$0.0003664** during its presale, the token‚Äôs price is poised to rise as it transitions to its next phase. With over **29,000 followers on X** and **12,500 members on Telegram**, the project‚Äôs grassroots appeal is undeniable.  

**Key Metrics:**  
- **Presale Funds Raised:** $39 million+  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum  
- **Community Size:** 29,000+ on X, 12,500+ on Telegram

## Why Wall Street Pepe Stands Out  

### FOMO-Driven Growth  
The success of **$PEPE**, which surged **18,644%** since its April 2024 launch, has created a blueprint for projects like $WEPE. Investors who missed out on $PEPE‚Äôs gains are now channeling their capital into newer meme coins, hoping to replicate similar returns.  

### Strategic Community Building  
Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs core philosophy, **‚ÄúFrogs Strong Together,‚Äù** emphasizes collective strength. The project‚Äôs **WEPE Army** initiative offers token holders exclusive access to trading strategies and ‚Äúalpha calls‚Äù (insider insights), empowering retail investors to compete with institutional ‚Äúwhales.‚Äù  

**WEPE Army Benefits:**  
- Real-time trading signals  
- Community-driven decision-making  
- Collaborative market analysis

## Elon Musk‚Äôs Influence on Meme Coins  

### The ‚ÄúMusk Effect‚Äù in Crypto

- His endorsement of $PEPE in 2024 contributed to its **9.5% gain** amid broader market corrections.
