# How to Add Custom Projects in imToken (Adding HT Token Guide)  

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Custom Tokens in imToken  

imToken is a blockchain digital asset management tool that provides secure and reliable services for managing cryptocurrencies. To add custom tokens or projects like HT (Huobi Token), follow these structured steps:  

### 1. Understanding imToken's Token Display Logic  
imTokenâ€™s default token list only displays partner tokens. Other tokens appear automatically if they have a non-zero balance in your wallet or can be manually added via search.  

### 2. Adding Tokens via Name or Contract Address  
- **Search by Token Name**: Open the imToken app, navigate to "Wallet" > "Add Asset" > "Add Token," then search for the token (e.g., HT) and select it.  
- **Search by Contract Address**: If the token isnâ€™t searchable, enter its contract address manually under the "Add Token" menu.  

### 3. Submitting New Tokens to imToken  
If your token isnâ€™t listed, submit its details (contract address and logo) via the "Submit New Token" option at the bottom of the token search page.  

### 4. Adding HT Token (Huobi Token)  
1. Ensure you have an ETH wallet (for ERC-20 tokens) or TRON wallet (for TRC-20 tokens) in imToken.  
2. Go to "Wallet" > "Add Asset" > "Add Token."  
3. Search for "HT" or enter its contract address:  
   - **ERC-20**: `0x6f259637dcd74c76778d691b3b7f583d905ce55d`  
   - **TRC-20**: `TWFNbfQc8K1k4YKjXgjw8KqD75wjwmc1mf`
