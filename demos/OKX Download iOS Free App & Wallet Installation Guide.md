## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Can't I Find TRC20/ERC20 Networks?
Following system upgrades, network names now display as their underlying blockchain (e.g., "Tron" instead of "TRC20"). This change improves transparency and reduces user confusion during cross-chain transactions.

### How Do Blockchain Confirmations Work?
Each confirmation represents a block added to the chain. Required confirmations vary by cryptocurrency:
| Crypto | Network Confirmations |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Bitcoin | 1-6 blocks |
| Ethereum | 12-30 blocks |
| USDT (Tron) | 1 block |

### How Are Transaction Fees Calculated?
Receiving crypto incurs no fees. Sending crypto requires:
1. Network gas fees (paid by sender)
2. Exchange processing fees (0.02%-0.2%)
Example: Sending BTC from OKX to another wallet requires network fees determined by blockchain congestion.
