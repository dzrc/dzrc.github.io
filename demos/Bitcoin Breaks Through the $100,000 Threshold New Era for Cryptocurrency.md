## Key Catalysts for Bitcoin's Surge  

### Political Landscape Shaping Crypto Markets  
The Republican party's control of both Congressional chambers has introduced transformative policy possibilities. Credit rating agency Moody's highlights that pro-growth fiscal policies under a Trump administration could accelerate inflationary pressures, diminishing the U.S. dollar's global dominance. With Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins, its appeal as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation has intensified.  

Notable policy proposals include:  
- Replacing SEC leadership with crypto-friendly regulators  
- Establishing clear frameworks for blockchain innovation  
- Promoting digital asset adoption across federal agencies  

### Geopolitical Tensions Driving Adoption  
The prolonged Ukraine-Russia conflict has exposed vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems. Western sanctions on Russia have catalyzed discussions among BRICS nations about alternative settlement mechanisms. While dollar-based systems remain dominant, Bitcoin's borderless nature and censorship-resistant properties position it as an attractive intermediary for cross-border transactions.  

### Institutional Infrastructure Expansion  
The growing availability of regulated investment vehicles has democratized crypto exposure. Hong Kong-listed ETFs now offer diverse access points for traditional investors:  

| ETF Name                  | Ticker Symbol | Underlying Asset |  
|---------------------------|---------------|------------------|  
| CSOP Bitcoin ETF          | 3008.HK         | Bitcoin          |  
| Harvest Bitcoin ETF       | 3179.HK         | Bitcoin          |
