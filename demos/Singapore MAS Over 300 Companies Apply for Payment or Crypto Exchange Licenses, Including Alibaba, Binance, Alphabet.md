## Balancing Innovation with Caution

While Singapore actively promotes fintech development, MAS maintains a cautious stance toward cryptocurrency investment. Mohanty reiterated ongoing concerns about market volatility:  
> "Bitcoin remains a speculative asset class. We consistently warn citizens about the risks of investing in complex financial instruments they don't fully understand."

The regulator's approach combines:
1. **Strict licensing requirements** for institutional players
2. **Public education campaigns** about crypto risks
3. **Collaborative sandbox programs** for controlled innovation

### Institutional Infrastructure Development

Singapore's strategic vision focuses on building foundational digital infrastructure through initiatives like:
- **SGX's crypto derivatives market**: Aiming to become Asia's BTC/ETH pricing benchmark
- **Partior Network**: Creating a blockchain-based settlement backbone for cross-border payments
- **Digital SGD pilot**: Exploring central bank digital currency (CBDC) applications

Mohanty highlighted the importance of these frameworks:  
> "When we establish institutional-grade platforms like Partior, we create the infrastructure that will make digital asset trading mainstream and secure."
