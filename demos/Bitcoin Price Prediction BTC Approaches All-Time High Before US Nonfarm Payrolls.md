# Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Approaches All-Time High Before US Nonfarm Payrolls  

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $109,000 on Thursday, breaking out of a consolidation phase and nearing its all-time high. This movement coincides with improving macroeconomic conditions and the announcement of a US-Vietnam trade agreement boosting risk appetite. Traders are now closely monitoring the upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for insights into the Federal Reserve's rate trajectory.  

## Bitcoin Traders Await NFP Report for Clarity  

As Bitcoin trades above $109,000, market participants are adopting a cautious stance ahead of the NFP data release. This report could provide critical signals about the Fed's monetary policy, directly impacting USD demand and risk assets like Bitcoin. Analysts at FXStreet note a 25% probability of a Fed rate cut in late July 2025, with a near-certainty of a 25-basis-point reduction in September.

### Market Sentiment and Rate Cut Scenarios  
- **Bullish Scenario**: A dovish NFP report supporting rate cuts could increase liquidity, boosting investor appetite for high-risk assets like BTC.  
- **Bearish Scenario**: Strong employment data might delay rate cuts, potentially triggering short-term corrections in crypto markets.  

## Trade Agreements Fuel Risk Appetite  

The US-Vietnam trade deal eliminates 20% tariffs on Vietnamese exports, while reciprocal market access concessions create a more favorable environment for risk assets. Similarly, eased restrictions on Chinese semiconductor design software indicate broader trade normalization efforts.  

### Key Trade Developments Influencing BTC:  
| Agreement | Impact on Crypto Markets |  
|-----------|--------------------------|  
| US-Vietnam Tariff Removal | Boosts investor confidence |  
| China Semiconductor Policy | Reduces tech sector uncertainty |  
| Trump's "OBBB" Budget Bill | Potential market volatility catalyst |  

## Institutional Demand Resurges  

US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $407.78 million inflows on Wednesday, reversing $342.25 million outflows from the previous day. This reversal suggests growing institutional interest, though sustained inflows are needed to push BTC toward its all-time high.  

### Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum  
- **RSI**: RSI-14 at 59 on daily charts, showing strengthening bullish momentum  
- **MACD**: Bullish crossover with rising histogram bars above neutral zone  
- **Price Targets**:  
  - Immediate resistance: $111,980 (May 22 high)  
  - Short-term support: $108,355 (consolidation zone upper boundary)

## Macroeconomic Forces Driving BTC's Surge  

The US M2 money supply reached $21.94 trillion in May 2025, up 4.5% YoY, creating favorable conditions for asset inflation. This aligns with Standard Chartered's bullish forecast projecting BTC at $135,000 by 2025 year-end and potentially $200,000 in 2026.  

### Historical Correlation Between M2 and BTC  
| Period | M2 Growth | BTC Price Change |  
|--------|-----------|------------------|  
| 2020-2021 | +25% | +600% |  
| 2023-2025 | +6% YoY | +220% (Projected) |

## Conclusion: BTC's Path to New Heights  

Bitcoin's current technical setup and macroeconomic environment suggest strong potential for reaching new all-time highs. While short-term corrections below $108,355 could test $105,333 support, sustained ETF inflows and dovish Fed policies position BTC for sustained growth. Investors should monitor the NFP report and trade agreement developments as critical market catalysts.
