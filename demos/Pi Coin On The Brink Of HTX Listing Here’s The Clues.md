# Pi Coin On The Brink Of HTX Listing? Here‚Äôs The Clues  

## HTX Drops Pi Coin Listing Clues: Pi Price Rally Building Up?  

Ahead of a major crypto conference, Pi Network gains attention on HTX‚Äôs social media platforms, sparking speculation about a potential listing. With over 35 million active users globally, the mobile-mining pioneer‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, Pi coin (PI), has hovered near the $0.60 psychological threshold for the past week. This development could signal a turning point for the project, which has struggled with market volatility since its mainnet launch.

## Pi Coin‚Äôs Downward Trend Coming To Halt?  

Since reaching an all-time high of $2.99 within days of its mainnet launch, Pi coin has experienced an 80% decline. Key factors contributing to this slump include:  
- **Market Sentiment**: Broader crypto market fears impacting investor confidence.  
- **Token Unlock Schedule**: Aggressive token releases creating selling pressure.  
- **Exchange Limitations**: Lack of support from top-tier exchanges like Binance and Bybit.  

Currently ranked #33 by market cap, Pi coin is listed on platforms like OKX, MEXC, Bitget, and Gate.io. However, the absence of major exchange backing has pushed users toward decentralized alternatives. For instance, KuCoin‚Äôs Pi Network page explicitly directs traders to DeFi platforms for purchases.

## HTX Seems To Be Building Up Pi Coin Listing  

Recent activity suggests HTX (formerly Huobi) might be preparing to list Pi coin. The 14th-largest exchange by trading volume shared a cryptic post featuring a skyscraper in Pi Network‚Äôs signature purple and gold colors. This visual nod has ignited speculation within the community.  

### Why HTX Listing Matters  
1. **Liquidity Boost**: HTX‚Äôs user base could inject significant trading volume.  
2. **Credibility**: Listing on a reputable exchange validates Pi Network‚Äôs long-term viability.  
3. **Price Catalyst**: Historical data shows exchange listings often precede price surges.  

The timing aligns with Pi Network‚Äôs participation in the **Consensus Summit** in Hong Kong, where industry leaders like Dr. Altcoin predict a May bull rally. Additionally, the token unlock schedule slows in late August, potentially reducing downward pressure.

## On The Flipside: Risks And Challenges  

While optimism grows, concerns persist:

Pi Network‚Äôs mobile-first approach has democratized crypto mining, attracting millions of users worldwide. A potential HTX listing could:  
- **Expand Accessibility**: Introduce Pi coin to institutional investors.  
- **Stabilize Price**: Reduce volatility through increased liquidity.  
- **Boost Mainstream Adoption**: Leverage HTX‚Äôs global reach to onboard new users.

| Jan 2025       | 8.5M              | $5.1M                |  
| Aug 2025       | 3.2M              | $1.92M               |  

This reduction aligns with potential listing timelines, suggesting strategic planning to mitigate price crashes.
