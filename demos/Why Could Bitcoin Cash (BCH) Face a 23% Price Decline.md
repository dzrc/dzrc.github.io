## Technical Resistance and Support Levels

### 50-Week EMA as a Major Barrier  
BCH has repeatedly failed toÁ™ÅÁ†¥ its 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently hovering around $350.2. This persistent rejection has created a psychological ceiling for traders, culminating in a 9% weekly drop to $324.2 on Thursday. The inability to sustain momentum above the EMA signals weak bullish conviction and heightened selling pressure.

### Crucial Support Zone at Risk  
The immediate support zone for BCH lies between $299.7 and $280.6, a range critical for weekly and monthly stability. A close below $280.6 could trigger a cascade of sell orders, potentially driving the price down 23% to retest the December 11, 2023, low of $210.1. Additionally, a breakdown below this zone would invalidate the ascending trendline drawn from June 2023 lows, further confirming bearish dominance.

## On-Chain Data Signals Weakness

### OI-Weighted Funding Rate: A Bearish Indicator  
The OI-Weighted Funding Rate for BCH stands at -0.026%, reflecting a negative skew where shorts compensate longs. This metric, derived from futures contracts weighted by open interest (OI), highlights growing bearish sentiment. Historically, sustained negative funding rates precede downward trends as traders position for further declines.

### Momentum Indicators Confirm Downturn  
Technical oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) have dipped below neutral thresholds (50 for RSI, 0 for AO). These readings underscore weakening buyer momentum and increasing likelihood of extended losses unless a strong reversal occurs.

## Potential Bullish Reversal Scenarios

### Breaking the $378 Resistance  
A weekly close above $378 would invalidate the current bearish thesis, potentially igniting a 19% rally to $459.2‚Äîthe level last seen on July 29. This move would signal renewed bullish appetite and could attract institutional inflows, altering the short-term trajectory.

### Monitoring Key Metrics  
Traders should closely watch the OI-Weighted Funding Rate for shifts above zero, which could indicate stabilizing sentiment. Similarly, a rebound in RSI above 50 would suggest momentum is tilting back to buyers.
